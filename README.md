# bitrathdotcom

### What is `bitrathdotcom` ?

The idea of 'bitrathdotcom' was born as a course project at my Bachelor's Computer Engineering degree at the University Of Parma.

The concept behind it is very simple: my goal was to provide a full-stack website template aimed to the demographic of the Artists like Photographers, Painters, etc...

These assumptions naturally led to a very basic scruture of the main components of this website into three main categories:

- Portfolio
- Shop
- Blog

Being an amateur photographer myself, I decided to structure the entire project as my personal website. Therefore I had to exclude from the git repository every photo, due to copyright reasons.

Nontheless, you can implement your personal photos and data into the Websites.
